N-BODY
======

http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=nbody&lang=gcc&id=2

The base source code used for benchmarking is in this directory.

This is modified as little as possible to be compilable by the
compilers under test and any modified source code is present in
subdirectories.

When compiling n-body, several defines are possible:

/*
 * COMMAND LINE DEFINES
 *
 * -DSTATIC
 * Make locals static.
 *
 * -DPRINTF
 * Enable printing of results.
 *
 * -DTIMER
 * Insert asm labels into source code at timing points (Z88DK).
 *
 * -DCOMMAND
 * Enable reading of N from the command line.
 *
 */

All compiles are first checked for correctness by running the program
with PRINTF defined.  After correctness is verified, time should be
measured with PRINTF undefined so that execution time of printf is not
measured.

=====================================

N=1000

-0.169075164
-0.169087605

=====================================

TIMER is defined for Z88DK compiles so that assembly labels are inserted
into the code at time begin and time stop points.

When COMMAND is not defined, N=1000.

BENCHMARKS GAME COMMENTS
========================

Background
----------

Model the orbits of Jovian planets, using the same simple symplectic-integrator.

Thanks to Mark C. Lewis for suggesting this task.

Useful symplectic integrators are freely available, for example the HNBody Symplectic Integration Package.

How to implement
----------------

We ask that contributed programs not only give the correct result, but also use the same algorithm to calculate that result.

Each program should:

    use the same simple symplectic-integrator - see the Java program.
